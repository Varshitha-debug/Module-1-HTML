# 🌐 Local Community Event Portal

A lightweight, browser-based portal developed using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** to help local residents register for events, view event galleries, give feedback, and more — all within the browser, without requiring backend setup.

## 📌 Project Overview

This portal is a mini-project based on HTML5 learning exercises designed to demonstrate semantic HTML, DOM interactions, styling, local storage, geolocation, and media elements.
